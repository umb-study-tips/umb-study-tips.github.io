              Everyone knows social media can be distracting when you should be doing work, but few realize how bad the problem really is. It isn't really the amount of time you are wasting, a few short walks throughout the day could be longer and provide greater benefits to concentrating when you are working. It really falls into a concept called deep work. These days, most of the best jobs require great focus to achieve high quality results, whether it's studying really hard to get the grades to qualify for really good entry level jobs or it's studying the scientific literature and forming your own hypotheses in a lab. The best administrative jobs like CEO are nothing, but distractions all day, but these jobs are very competitive and unlikely to get so your best bet to be successful is to get good at deep work. In order to come up with creative solutions to problems you need deep concentration whether that be for hours on end or for short bursts throughout day<br /><br />
              
               The problem with social media is not only the intense competing useless information gained, however enjoyable it is, but also the fact that the mere act of checking your phone switches your brain into a completely different mode, that of responding to a funny picture. When you go back to your work it can take a really long time to remember where you were, what your were doing, and the kinds of solutions you were about to think of. 
                In fact, there is a state in which you are totally immersed, energized, and focused on your task called flow. This is not easily attained every work session, but it only occurs when you are totally concentrating and not distracted.
                <br /><br />
     
              What's worse is that by always caving to distractions during your work, you actively weaken the metaphorical muscle in your brain that helps you focus and make it harder next time to concentrate. It is therefore a good idea to try to limit distractions when you work and to relax with your nice intoxicating distractions when the day's work is done.<br /><br />
