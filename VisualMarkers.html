               Now this technique is a little cutting edge and takes so long to get good enough to see real tangible results that maybe you should focus on the more basic, immediately helpful techniques, but that isn’t to say this isn’t powerful. I won’t go into the kind of detail that will turn you into a memory athlete, but the pros do have a few helpful tips to improve memory.<br /><br />
               
				       In order to remember more effectively it is helpful to give the knowledge a sort of emotional impact. The idea is visualizing a scene including all the relevant details in sets of 3-5 things that can be both living and inanimate. (3-5 at a time because your brain likes to chunk things this way) The idea is to make the information easy to grab in the other techniques such as active learning by making it distinct. This means to dualcode facts with funny connections, sexual connections, emotionally poignant connections, etc. Anything that is meaningful enough to be one of the first things to come to your head to connect the info you need to remember. You might think that the amount of time and effort it takes to think of a memorable visual marker for a concept or term is not worth it, but it is simply the case that true learning is an active process and this technique makes memories stick way better than simple repetition can.<br /><br />
               
                This could be like visualizing Japanese characters as characters who act out a wacky story every time they are brought together in a unique way for a new word. Doing things like these helps you remember things because it strengthens neural connections in many ways making it stick stronger in your head. And most importantly IT’S FUN. It’s no replacement for all the other techniques, but it’s yet another way to augment your studying. Who would have thought that making studying more creative, more imaginative would have such great outcomes.<br /><br />
