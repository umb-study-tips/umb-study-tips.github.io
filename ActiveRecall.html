               One of the commandments of the finest study gurus throughout the land is that rote memorization DOESN'T WORK. By rereading and rereading and rereading the
			   textbook, you do feel mighty productive and devoted don't you, but you're wasting your time. (Don't confuse this with deliberate practice such as with math
			   problems and music practice: see here).<br /><br />
				Studying through pure repetition is by far the most popular study method. On its surface, it seems pretty straightforward: you have information that's hard
				to remember therefore you need to make it familiar and more likely to come to mind. What else will make weird information that you've never seen before and
				has no practical purpose in your life stick in your brain long enough to ace the test.<br /><br /> 
				The tried and true pillar of real studying is active learning. When you force yourself to recall something to the best of your ability, you signal to your
				oblivious subconscious that this knowledge is very important to you right now. In other words, you strengthen connections in a way that rote memorization
				cannot do. <br /><br />
                This active recall can occur in the form of self-made or obtained practice tests, trying to explain concepts to your friends and family
				(feynman method), quizzing yourself with flashcards periodically (spaced repetition is helpful here), and drawing spider diagrams of the
				information (for those creatively inclined). It's quite painfully challenging at first to come face to face with the gaps in your knowledge, but it's
				a hurdle one must conquer to do well in the classroom.<br /><br />
