               One of the commandments of the finest study gurus throughout the land is that rote memorization DOESN’T WORK. By rereading and rereading and rereading the <br />
			   textbook, you do feel mighty productive and devoted don’t you, but you’re wasting your time. (Don’t confuse this with deliberate practice such as with math <br />
			   problems and music practice: see here).<br /> 
				Studying through pure repetition is by far the most popular study method. On its surface, it seems pretty straightforward: you have information that’s hard <br />
				to remember therefore you need to make it familiar and more likely to come to mind. What else will make weird information that you’ve never seen before and <br />
				has no practical purpose in your life stick in your brain long enough to ace the test.<br /> 
				The tried and true pillar of real studying is active learning. When you force yourself to recall something to the best of your ability, you signal to your <br />
				oblivious subconscious that this knowledge is very important to you right now. In other words, you strengthen connections in a way that rote memorization <br />
				cannot do. This active recall can occur in the form of self-made or obtained practice tests, trying to explain concepts to your friends and family <br />
				(feynman method), quizzing yourself with flashcards periodically (spaced repetition is helpful here), and drawing spider diagrams of the <br />
				information (for those creatively inclined). It’s quite painfully challenging at first to come face to face with the gaps in your knowledge, but it’s <br />
				a hurdle one must conquer to do well in the classroom.<br />
