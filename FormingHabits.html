              Willpower is a vital though limited resource to get what you need to get done. It is a good idea to work out your willpower, but somedays you just donâ€™t have it in you. You do want progress, but willpower is sometimes just too hard to come by. However there is a long-term solution. Your brain is equipped with a rewards system that just makes life worth living and gets you to do what you need to do. One quick cheap trick against bad habits is not to fight the bad habit but replace it. If you always feel an urge to browse social media when you are bored and feeling stuck in work, try taking five min walk to clear your head since your mind is probably just desperate for a break from the frustration. The social media can bring you down an addictive rabbit hole, but the walk, as exercise does, can wake you up and get you out of ruts as the default mode network operates. You basically need to identify the cue your bad habit responds to and the need it subconsciously fulfills so you can replace the habit with a healthier one that fulfills the same need. <br /><br />

              To craft habits yourself however it will require more work. You need to come up with a cue such as your alarm clock going off to cue you to start your morning routine which can itself be a cue to exercise. The cues can be a chain. You will need to choose a habit to start with that will benefit your life greatly, but only do one at a time unless you get really good at this because habit forming can be hard at first. Finally you need a reward, the more primal the better. If you read an ebook while eating to do a reading habit then the need to eat is the cue and eating is the reward that you just shove in there. A sense of satisfaction can work as a reward in a pinch but it is less effective due to its non-short-term nature. The final ingredient is determination and not just the willpower to keep doing it everyday, but also the willingness to go right back to the habit after failing one day as failing one day will do nothing to the habit but failing a week could destroy it in the early stages. Just stay strong and realize that everyday, the habit will take less willpower and eventually it will just be automatic and you can start to work on other ways to improve your life. <br /><br />
