              The act of learning is one of creation and integration. It is an active process which is hindered by ruts that can impede learning and slow things. The goal is to make as many connections in your brain as possible with many techniques discussed on this site, but this article will discuss some passive ways to increase retention that will just be a nice addition to the process<br /><br />
              
              One way to increase retention is to study in a variety of locations. The break up of your study session with walks is already amazingly healthy, but there are also benefits, such as tying knowledge closer to many different locations as opposed to just one, which can help increase connections of the knowledge in your head and make them stick. <br /><br />
        
              Another way to increase retention is to change up your study methods. There are so many effective ones to choose from and there are so many ways to implement them that you can get creative and use them as you see fit but there are scientifically proven benefits to small modifications to your studying routine. Perhaps it increases adaptability, but it sure does help to change things up a little from time to time and it’s fun!<br /><br />
              
              One final way to help retention is a little less passive, but  nifty at the same time. Switching between subjects during long study sessions can really help get you out of ruts in your studying. It may not help with focus for dedicated projects, but it truly does help to change your mindset of studying. The thing is that you don’t learn effectively by going through things unit by unit in one specific topic for long hours, but rather by finding connections between many different interdisciplinary topics in short bursts. If you have four four-hour-sessions in a week, then don’t spend each one on a different subject, but rather one hour of each of the four subjects every day. You’ll be spontaneously (or even actively if you want)  finding useful connections between things that will really augment your learning process. <br /><br />
