              Again and again we come across intuitive concepts of studying that make so much sense once you learn them, however, they’re so vital, yet unknown by the vast majority of people. Deliberate practice, as many other studying concepts are, is a more of a way of living than an actual technique. Many of us while studying assume that before we go on to the harder stuff, we need to really master the basics. We assume that true learning must be systematic, rigorous, and slow, but the thing is: learning is based on what your brain thinks it needs to know. Going back to chapter one to thoroughly go through the basics you already know again(assuming you studied them well before) is a massive waste of time. Your brain learns by being forced to use the knowledge it has gained to understand topics that are built upon those basics. If you really get stuck and can’t understand, it is always a good idea to go back to review the basics if you missed a logical step or concept, but now you are going to re-study the basics with a clear goal in mind, to understand the bigger concept as opposed to passively going over the first chapter hoping to understand the next chapter eventually. <br /><br />

              The concept of deliberate practice is that of constantly pushing yourself to the line where what you know meets what you don’t know. It’s there that you will realize the exact basics you need to go through again so that you can approach the problem. When studying math from the textbook, it’s important to only do the problems from each chapter that pose a real challenge to your current level of knowledge without overwhelming yourself. Avoid the problems that you can do backwards and forwards like the plague. The correct mode of studying a subject like math is often a pretty organic feedback process where, if the concepts are too easy, go up to more difficult problems, and if the problems are  too hard go back a few sections or even whole chapters if you have to because they will be on the test. If you’re studying music, you aren’t learning by doing the same scale at the same speed over and over again. You need to up the difficulty in a variety of ways. You also need to apply the skills learned in this practice of scales practically with songs in order to see how your skills are and what needs to be improved deliberately. It is only pushing yourself to do more that you can one day get yourself to a point you couldn’t have imagined reaching at the beginning of your journey. <br /><br />
