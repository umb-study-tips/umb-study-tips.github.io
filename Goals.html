              Interestingly enough, only 8% of people actually accomplish their New Year’s resolutions. As an ashamed member of the 92%, you might ask yourself: how do these people do it? And you see it’s not hard, but it is a real mindset change.<br /><br />
              For starters, do not let your ideals crush you. Most people set crazy goals that really only serve to shame them everyday and make them feel like a worthless human being. Now I’m not saying not to dream big, but that the broad scary goals approach will usually not work for you unless you’re already a legend at getting things done.<br /><br />
              The thing is that in order to become the person of your dreams, you need to think of focusing not on the superficial achievements that you wish for, but really the underlying systems that govern your life. You have a program, which you construct consciously or unconsciously, and you’ll never maximize your potential if you just let chance and impulse govern what you do with your life. (More on schedules and more of habits).<br /><br />
              This article won’t have an in-depth discussion about the implementation of such philosophies, but I’ll leave you with a nice way of looking at life that will help you understand the material.. Imagine that you are a Japanese business executive of a car company following the traditional Japanese concept of kaizen. In order to truly dominate the car market in the future, you don’t need to come up with radical, revolutionary concepts right away.  All you need to do is focus on the small issues with your car design, which you can see. Focus right now, on that which you know you can improve right now. Focus on what you see is obviously wrong with the car even if it is a small thing. It’s the small, easy-to-implement things that can accumulate to make the greatest change and progress in your life and your products. What the Japanese car maker is trying to do is to make a car that is affordable for them to make and sell, safer to drive, and easier to mass-produce. What you’re trying to do is to fashion daily habits that bring meaning, accomplishment, and fulfillment to your life, and the only way to do something is to start small because the larger things you need to fix will announce themselves when you’ve solved the small things that shield your vision.<br /><br />
