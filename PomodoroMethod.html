              Who would have thought that taking short breaks was so important for retention of information and creativity? The pomodoro method, named for a cute italian tomato timer, is a method that is so effective that it's hard to believe.<br /><br />
              Surprising as it sounds, we do not retain information well by working in long, uninterrupted stretches, especially if we are bored and tired. If you are lucky and passionate, and have achieved a flow in this particular session, then I am happy for you, turn off your timer and chug along. However, you need to be aware of when you are too tired and worn out to work efficiently any longer. If that's the case, a short 15 minute break might be of good use.<br /><br />
              For those of us who are just toiling away at the work and have not been blessed with flow this session, use the inherent structure of the pomodoro session to ease your studying process. The thing is, our brain has two modes: the default mode and the focused mode (alpha mode and beta mode respectively). When you are in focused mode during studying only specific parts of your brain are working really hard because you are focusing on optimizing them and them alone when working on something. However, by working so intensely for such a long time, you are missing out on the connections that can be gained by engaging the whole brain.<br /><br />
              It just so happens that when you aren't focusing on anything much, your subconscious is making the connections that will really help you in fortifying knowledge or thinking of intuitive solutions to what you are working on. That is why it is a good practice to set timers that remind you to get up, take a walk, get water, go to the bathroom, or listen to music for 5-10 minutes. Checking social media could be a tad too distracting or could tempt you to extend your break so it could be best to not break with this, the goal after all is to get work done efficiently not relax at this part of the day.<br /><br />
              Most people start with work sessions of 25 minutes because honestly our attention spans aren't too good, but you can slowly increase your sessions, especially once you start to get into flow and are really inclined to ignore the timer. You'll really start to feel refreshed after each break as opposed to just being really destroyed at the end of a really long practice session you forced yourself to go through.<br /><br />
