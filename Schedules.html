                Many of us, including me have always hated schedules and have never been able to follow them but we were simply doing them wrong. Schedules are supposed to be about getting to design a perfect day that you would enjoy having deeply. They are NOT about being a tyrant to yourself and shaming yourself when you are most tired and least motivated later. You realistically will not have as much energy as you do now, crafting this hyper productive schedule.<br/ ><br />

                You need to be realistic in your needs about relaxation time that you cherish. Scheduling a nonstop chunk of work for longer than four hours is always a bad plan because how are you going to have energy to finish the other 4 hours of your work day. You NEED breaks, you need them, in order to be mentally healthy, in order to be creative, in order to be efficient. Now that isn't to say that you should just get up when you are really into some piece of work and are very productive, but forcing yourself to study until you are practically falling asleep at the keyboard is not a good idea.<br /><br />

                The best schedulers, start scheduling in the playtime and downtime first and schedule in work AROUND that. You know what your needs are and maybe you can cut back to get more done but you need to respect your personal needs because your body will rebel and make your worktime a truly hellish experience.<br /><br />

                You also need to focus on your priorities. You are only one person and can accomplish only so much in one day. You can have seasons of activities but having too many goals at once just makes it hard to accomplish any at all. It is better to spend a month or two learning Japanese and then two months after that in Spanish then to learn them both at once. That isn't to deny the benefits of interleaving (see link) but to avoid having too many conflicting goals to accomplish at once. Indeed, the idea of choosing a day you would like to have and that accomplishes your goals is truly a beautiful idea, you just need to make sure you are smart and truthful about what you can do.<br /><br />
