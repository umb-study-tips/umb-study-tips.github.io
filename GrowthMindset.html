              One of the fundamental concepts that lies at the heart of self-improvement is actually believing that you can improve. In order to truly change yourself, you shouldn't think of yourself as static or unchanging. You have to realize that you can grow and evolve into a better version of yourself in whatever it may be. Similarly, you could view your goal as finding happiness, but that often assumes, as most interpret, that happiness is a destination  that you get to in order to feel content., However, what you are really after is fulfillment. <br /><br /> 

              Many people view themselves and others as static beings. They think the prime goal is to not let others find out how incompetent they really are and that's how they view working. The person with the growth mindset knows that no one truly knows what they're doing and knows that every mistake is not an exposing of their fraud, but a learning opportunity if they use it right. Every mistake you make and learn from is another step to a kind of mastery that will bring deep meaning to your life. <br /><br />

              We are beings that need something to grow toward. Our relationships based on mutual shared goals prosper. Those who have a purpose in life are happier, healthier, and accomplish more. You are the part of your body that changes the whole to be more inclined to prosper so you better act like it. <br /><br />
