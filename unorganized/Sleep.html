               With all the work we have to do, hobbies we want to pursue, and goals we want to achieve it is pretty tempting to simply put off sleep til later or simply sleep less, after all if I sleep less I can get way more work done with all those extra hours. However sleep is not just some hobby our brain likes to do for fun. If you're a student skipping out on sleep, you are losing critical memory strengthening sleep cycles at the same time as taking longer to do your work because you are tired. If you're an athlete, you are skipping out on the vital muscle restoring hours in the middle of sleep where natural growth hormones are sent around the body to fix and strengthen the wears and tears of the day. It is simply a fact that skipping out on the unique amount of sleep your body needs is depriving your body and mind what it needs to succeed and be healthy.<br /><br />

                Whether you can or can't increase your hours in this hectic world, you should at least improve the quality of your sleep. Blue light from phones disrupts your circadian rhythms and makes your brain think it's daytime and thus makes falling asleep harder and quality of sleep worse. Eating way too much right before bed can also make your sleep worse as a ton of energy is wasted on digesting when it could be used for healing. Good, vigorous, exercise in the morning, though not right before bed can strengthen your sleep later and help you concentrate when you go to work. We all hate feeling tired all the time due to our lack of consideration for our bodies, but it's simply a must that we take the time to get our winks if we want to truly perform our best.
