                There is a really neat feature about our brains that can be viewed in both a positive and negative light. Our brain truly keeps only that which it feels it needs. Of course active recall and visual markers can help tons, but the thing is your brain is an optimization machine. Taxi cab drivers have greater brain sizes in the areas that help with visualizing maps and navigating, but the thing is when they retire, their brains very quickly shrink in those areas.<br /><br />

                The best way  to keep the facts in your head for your test is to hack that system because there is a major benefit to this system. In order to learn the most effectively, you need to space things out, not only to gain the benefits of fortifying memories during sleep and gaining the time saved by having shorter study sessions over longer periods of time, but also because it leads to better understanding, comprehension, and retention.<br /><br />

                The way it works is that you learn something using the variety of useful techniques we discussed and then after a short period of time, you forget more and more of the details. You then force yourself to try to remember the details and restudy those that you forgot. What's amazing is that you can remember things even better when you recall things just at the point you were about to forget them. This means restudying something an hour later, half a day later, a few days later, etc with longer and longer time spans.<br /><br />

                But wait, there is a major problem in that this method is really clunky and hard to set up yourself at first. Also, it can be a major time drain as at first the topics are bunched up at really short intervals. This is why you need to use a study app called anki that does all the hard work for you by automatically calculating when to show you the next flashcard based on how hard you rate recalling the information on it. If you keep doing daily, consistent study sessions, you can get so much value out of this method that you'll feel like a monster by the end with what you can recall with ease.
